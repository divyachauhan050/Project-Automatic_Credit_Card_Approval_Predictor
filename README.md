# Project - Automatic Credit Card Approval Predictor

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays.

In this project, I built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do.

## About the Datasets
I have used the [Credit Card Approval dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>
<li>We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.</li>
<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>
<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>
<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>

## Key Findings

**Business Question that I try to answer: "What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?"**

These are some of the key findings for this project:
1. **Banking and Finance** is an excellent industry to be in from a longetivity perspective.

2. **Caf√©s, Restaurants & Bars** is another industry sector that has been around for a really, really, long time.

3. The continent-wise breakup for the different industry categories and the earliest year that records their existence is as follows:

# Project - Automatic Credit Card Approval Predictor

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays.

In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

## About the Datasets
I have used three different datasets (courtesy of Datacamp).

1. **‘businesses.csv’** contains the details about the name of the business, year the business was founded, the category code of the business, and the ISO 3166-1 3-letter country code.

2. **‘new_businesses.csv’** contains the same columns as the **‘businesses.csv’** table and lists the oldest businesses in a few of the missing countries. 

3. **‘countries.csv’** contains information about the ISO 3166-1 3-letter country code, name of the country, and name of the continent that the country exists in.

4. **‘categories.csv’** contains information about the description of the business categories.

## Key Findings

**Business Question that I try to answer: "What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?"**

These are some of the key findings for this project:
1. **Banking and Finance** is an excellent industry to be in from a longetivity perspective.

2. **Cafés, Restaurants & Bars** is another industry sector that has been around for a really, really, long time.

3. The continent-wise breakup for the different industry categories and the earliest year that records their existence is as follows:

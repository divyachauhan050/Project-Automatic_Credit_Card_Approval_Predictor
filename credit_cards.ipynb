Credit card applications\n","<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_558/img/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"></p>\n","<p>We'll use the <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>\n","<li>We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.</li>\n","<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>\n","<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>\n","<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>First, loading and viewing the dataset. We find that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"e6e6337b-d3eb-4453-a2db-529798bcb09f","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <th>10</th>\n","      <th>11</th>\n","      <th>12</th>\n","      <th>13</th>\n","      <th>14</th>\n","      <th>15</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>b</td>\n","      <td>30.83</td>\n","      <td>0.000</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>w</td>\n","      <td>v</td>\n","      <td>1.25</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00202</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>a</td>\n","      <td>58.67</td>\n","      <td>4.460</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>q</td>\n","      <td>h</td>\n","      <td>3.04</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00043</td>\n","      <td>560</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>a</td>\n","      <td>24.50</td>\n","      <td>0.500</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>q</td>\n","      <td>h</td>\n","      <td>1.50</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00280</td>\n","      <td>824</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>b</td>\n","      <td>27.83</td>\n","      <td>1.540</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>w</td>\n","      <td>v</td>\n","      <td>3.75</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00100</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>b</td>\n","      <td>20.17</td>\n","      <td>5.625</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>w</td>\n","      <td>v</td>\n","      <td>1.71</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>s</td>\n","      <td>00120</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["  0      1      2  3  4  5  6     7  8  9   10 11 12     13   14 15\n","0  b  30.83  0.000  u  g  w  v  1.25  t  t   1  f  g  00202    0  +\n","1  a  58.67  4.460  u  g  q  h  3.04  t  t   6  f  g  00043  560  +\n","2  a  24.50  0.500  u  g  q  h  1.50  t  f   0  f  g  00280  824  +\n","3  b  27.83  1.540  u  g  w  v  3.75  t  t   5  t  g  00100    3  +\n","4  b  20.17  5.625  u  g  w  v  1.71  t  f   0  f  s  00120    0  +"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["# Import pandas\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Load dataset\n","cc_apps = pd.read_csv('Datasets/cc_approvals.data', header = None)\n","\n","# Inspect data\n","display(cc_apps.head())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"363e641f-fefe-4add-b166-841d0c5aa675","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"10"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["## 2. Inspecting the applications\n","<p>The output may appear a bit confusing at its first sight, but let's try to figure out the most important features of a credit card application. The features of this dataset have been anonymized to protect the privacy, but <a href=\"http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/73039_9946de135c0a49daa7a0a9eda4a67a72.html\">this blog</a> gives us a pretty good overview of the probable features. The probable features in a typical credit card application are <code>Gender</code>, <code>Age</code>, <code>Debt</code>, <code>Married</code>, <code>BankCustomer</code>, <code>EducationLevel</code>, <code>Ethnicity</code>, <code>YearsEmployed</code>, <code>PriorDefault</code>, <code>Employed</code>, <code>CreditScore</code>, <code>DriversLicense</code>, <code>Citizen</code>, <code>ZipCode</code>, <code>Income</code> and finally the <code>ApprovalStatus</code>. This gives us a pretty good starting point, and we can map these features with respect to the columns in the output.   </p>\n","<p>As we can see from our first glance at the data, the dataset has a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features. This can be fixed with some preprocessing, but before we do that, let's learn about the dataset a bit more to see if there are other dataset issues that need to be fixed.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"caee2258-65b2-459b-9595-01772276d16d","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"10"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style

Because of this correlation, we'll take advantage of the fact that generalized linear models perform well in these cases.
